# Chad.AI Privacy Notice

_**Last updated: July 26, 2025**_

## 1. Data Controller and Contact Information

**Simon Kolehmainen**  
Email: thechadai@gmail.com

## 2. What Information We Collect

The app only collects the screenshots you choose to upload. These images are analyzed via Google Cloud Vision to extract the text. We do **not** collect or store device identifiers, location data, usage analytics, or use tracking libraries (e.g., Google Analytics) or advertising SDKs. Examples of data **not** collected include crash logs, advertising identifiers, and IP‑based geolocation.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The extracted text is sent to OpenAI’s GPT model to generate a flirty reply. We use your text **solely** to generate this reply and do not use it for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

We do **not** retain the screenshots or the extracted text after the reply has been generated and shown to you. All data is deleted automatically once the response is created.

## 5. Third‑Party Services

We rely on two external services:

- **Google Cloud Vision API** to recognize text from the images you upload.
- **OpenAI API** to generate the flirty response.

These providers may process your data outside the EU; their respective privacy policies apply. We do not share your data with any other third parties.

## 6. Legal Basis and Your Rights

We process your data based on your explicit consent under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the right to:

- Receive confirmation of whether we process your data.
- Access, correct, or delete your data.
- Withdraw your consent at any time (note: the app cannot function without this consent, as it relies on analyzing the screenshots you provide).

Since the app does not require a login and does not store data, your information is removed automatically as part of the normal process.

## 7. Data Security

We take technical and organizational measures to protect your data. Data is transmitted over secure connections (HTTPS) and is accessible only to the components necessary to generate the reply. Images and text are processed in an isolated environment and deleted immediately after processing.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Notice

We may update this notice as the service evolves. We will notify users of any material changes through the app. By continuing to use Chad.AI, you accept the updated terms.
